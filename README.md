<h2>🎓 A proud Computer Science grad with a knack for turning coffee into code and memes into machine learning models.</h2>

<h3>🧠 Currently on a quest to teach computers to understand sarcasm...it's going really well.</h3>

<h4>💻 When I'm not debugging, you can find me procrastinating by contributing to open-source projects or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (it's tabs, obviously).</h4>

<h5>🔍 Always up for a good nerdy joke or a brainstorming session on how to take over the world with AI.</h5>
