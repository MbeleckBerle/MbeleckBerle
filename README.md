**`Machine learning Enthusiast`**



- 🎓 A proud Computer Science grad with a knack for turning coffee into code and memes into machine learning models.
- 🧠 Currently on a quest to teach computers to understand sarcasm...it's going really well.
- 💻 When I'm not debugging, you can find me procrastinating by contributing to open-source projects or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (it's tabs, obviously).
- 🔍 Always up for a good nerdy joke or a brainstorming session on how to take over the world with AI.
- 🚀 Let's build something awesome together, one line of code and one laugh at a time! Connect with me and let's geek out!
