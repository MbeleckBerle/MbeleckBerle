##🎓 A proud Computer Science grad with a knack for turning coffee into code and memes into machine learning models.</br>

##🧠 Currently on a quest to teach computers to understand sarcasm...it's going really well.</br>

##💻 When I'm not debugging, you can find me procrastinating by contributing to open-source projects
##or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (it's tabs, obviously).</br>

##🔍 Always up for a good nerdy joke or a brainstorming session on how to take over the world with AI.</br>

##🚀 Let's build something awesome together, one line of code and one laugh at a time! Connect with me and let's geek out!
