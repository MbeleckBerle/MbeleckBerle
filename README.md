<ul>
<li> 🎓 A proud Computer Science grad with a knack for turning coffee into code and memes into machine learning models.</li>
<li> 🧠 Currently on a quest to teach computers to understand sarcasm...it's going really well.</li>
<li> 💻 When I'm not debugging, you can find me procrastinating by contributing to open-source projects or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (it's tabs, obviously).</li>
<li> 🔍 Always up for a good nerdy joke or a brainstorming session on how to take over the world with AI.</li>
<li> 🚀 Let's build something awesome together, one line of code and one laugh at a time! Connect with me and let's geek out!</li>
</ul>
